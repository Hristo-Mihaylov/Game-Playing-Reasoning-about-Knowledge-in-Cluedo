**Game Playing: Reasoning about Knowledge in Cluedo.**

You do not need any external libraries to run the code. You can view the **"how_to_play.txt"** file to give you a quick introduction to the rules in Cluedo.

In order to run the main game file, run the following command:

**python Main.py**

This main file is a combination of some of the files that are mentioned below.



Here are some commands that run classes used for testing:

To run one game between AIs only, run: **python TestingOnlyAI.py**

To run one game in which the user can play, run: **python TestWithUser.py**

Alternatively, in order to run multiple games (10000, but can be easily changed) between AIs only, you can run:

**python TestingMultipleGames.py**
